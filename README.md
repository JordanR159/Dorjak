#Dorjak, a Game for Everyone!
Welcome to Dorjak, a game about defending the sun from conveniently targeted asteroids! It is your mission to save the solar system, as just one of these packs enough punch to blow up the sun!

#Goal
Simply put, you are not going to defend the sun forever! Instead, just try your best to destroy as many asteroids as possible by blocking them with the planets. Don't worry, the inhabitants of these planets won't mind! Scoring is simple, as every asteroid destroyed adds one to your score. You won't see your score until you lose, as it only appear once the sun blows up. Go solo, or split the orbits with a friend for some fast-paced co-op action!
